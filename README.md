# AdventureExpoAndroidAPPusingReact
- Developed android app utilizing various React Native components such as View, Text, Image, TouchableOpacity, and
  ScrollView to build the user interface (UI).
- Employed a styling approach similar to CSS, utilizing stylesheets and inline styling.
- Utilized react-navigation, to handle navigation within the app for transitions between screens and efficient user flow.
- Integrated API calls into the project, utilizing ‘fetch’ to communicate with backend services and retrieve data in JSON
  format.
- Implemented data parsing (routes) and manipulation techniques to handle API responses, extracting relevant information
  and updating the application's state accordingly (useState and useEffect).
- Demonstrated handling asynchronous data loading (async/await) and error handling (try/catch).

  P.S - To run this you will need to first use npm commands to install node modules.
